# Days Off — unattended run progress

Run started 2026-10-27, RUN MODE (see CLAUDE.md "Unattended runs"). Stacked branches,
draft PRs, no merges — Atiyk merges in the evening. Re-read this file first if resumed
after a restart or context compaction.

## Phase 0 findings

- **Network reach**: `date.nager.at` → 200 OK, reachable. `pto-optimizer-seven.vercel.app`
  → 200 OK, reachable. `pto-optimizer.app` → no DNS resolution, not reachable from this
  sandbox (confirms it is not currently live, or at least not from here — Phase 1 will
  decide the SITE_URL default accordingly).
- **Headless screenshots**: Playwright's Chromium is NOT preinstalled. Installed via
  `npx playwright install chromium` (works fine, ~100MB download) and added `playwright`
  as a devDependency (`package.json`) so later phases can reuse it. New file
  `scripts/screenshot.mjs` — `node scripts/screenshot.mjs <url> <outPath> <width>
  <height>`.
- **Baseline test/tsc/build** (before any change):
  - `npm test`: 406 passed, 1 failed (`src/solver/solve.test.ts`, "every w from 0 to 100
    spends the same number of PTO days, at budget=40", a 5s timeout). This is the K9
    baseline's first known-flaky test. The second K9 test (`<1000ms` perf budget) did NOT
    fail on this run — timing-sensitive tests are inherently non-deterministic depending
    on machine load; both are recorded as baseline-known-flaky regardless of which one(s)
    actually trip on a given run.
  - `npx tsc --noEmit`: clean, exit 0.
  - `npm run build` (`tsc -b && vite build` + prerender postbuild): clean, exit 0. All 9
    routes (`/`, `/pto`, `/sabbatical`, 6 country routes) built and prerendered without
    error.
- **Before screenshots**: `docs/screenshots/phase-0/before-{landing,pto,sabbatical}-
  {1440,768,375}.png`, captured against `npm run preview` on port 4173.
  - **Routing note for local screenshots**: `vite preview` falls back to the root
    `index.html` for `/pto` and `/sabbatical` (no trailing slash) — it has no cleanUrls
    rewriting, unlike Vercel. Confirmed with `curl -I` (identical ETag for `/`, `/pto`,
    `/sabbatical`) and fixed by screenshotting `/pto/` and `/sabbatical/` (trailing
    slash) instead, which serves the correct file locally. **This is a local-preview-only
    quirk** — Vercel's `cleanUrls: true` (in `vercel.json`) explicitly supports exactly
    this directory-index lookup for the path with no trailing slash and no extension, and
    the site's existing country routes (`/uk`, `/canada`, etc.) already prove this works
    in production. No code change needed for this; noted here only so later phases don't
    misdiagnose a routing bug that only exists in the local screenshot tool.
  - **Confirms K1 directly**: `curl http://localhost:4173/sabbatical/` (prerendered HTML)
    shows all three placement cards as "30 days away, no holidays inside" — exactly the
    empty-holiday-set symptom the audit predicted, confirmed by reading the raw
    server-rendered markup rather than just the code.
